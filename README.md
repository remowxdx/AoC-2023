# Advent of code 2023


## Day 1

Whoa! About 40 minutes for the first problem...

OK, I lost about 20 minutes to understand that my script downloaded the
input of the last year.

And some time again to find that a digit written in letters could be
repeated more than one time.


## Day 2

... Not enough free time to also write comments ...


## Day 3

... Not enough free time to also write comments ...


## Day 4

Like last year, I really have to find a faster way to parse the input.
All those `split` are not good!

Anyway I solved the problem without much problems, once the script
ran without error, the solution was right.


## Day 5

Part 1 a little complex but not too much.

Part 2 complex in a way that I don't like, but solved anyway:
kept track of start and end of every range, splitting ranges
when going from one category to the next.

I had location 0 as the minimum location, because of a off-by-one
error. Corrected the next day.


## Day 6

Easy enough problem. I suspected that in part 2 you had to solve,
the equation $record\_distance = press\_time Â· (race\_time - press\_time)$,
but I solved anyway part 1 by brute force.

For the second part, I had to solve the equation

$$r = p (t-p)$$

$$r = pt - p^2$$

$$p^2-pt+r=0$$

$$x_{1,2} = {t \pm \sqrt{t^2-4r} \over 2}$$

$$x_2 -x_1 = \sqrt{t^2-4r}$$

to not have to wait too much time (this just to see how
github renders math).


## Day 7

Interesting poker problem... did find it too much difficult.
Found a relatively simple way to rank the `type` of the hand.
That helped for part 2.


## Day 8

This is the type of probelms that I like...

First part easily done in 12 minutes.

Second part... I tried solved it assuming that every cycle could
also pass thru many "Z" nodes and that the first nodes
could also not be touched in subsequent cycles.

Next time I'll just try with the least common multiple
of the first time a "Z" node is touched.

Anyway if multiple "Z" nodes are touched, my solution
still doesn't work.


## Day 9

Ahhh, I like it when there is a clean, simple recursive
solution! And that solution works!


## Day 10

This has been a long day...
Nearly two hours to solve!

Part 1 more or less straightforward, just create a grid with every cell
having the cells that are connected to it, and explore the loop from the
two sides until they encounter.

In part 2 I remade the grid with "bigger resolution": every cell is transformed
in 9 new cells, for example an "L" cell will be:

```
      .|.
 L -> .L-
      ...
```

That way I can flood the outside and then count what is not outside and
on the loop.


## Day 11

Luckily in part 1 I abstracted the universe with a width, height and
a set with the coordinates of the galaxies.

This way the second part was really easy to solve, I only needed
to add more line in the shift dictionaries.
