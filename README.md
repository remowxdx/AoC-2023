# Advent of code 2023

## Day 1

Whoa! About 40 minutes for the first problem...

OK, I lost about 20 minutes to understand that my script downloaded the
input of the last year.

And some time again to find that a digit written in letters could be
repeated more than one time.

## Day 2

... Not enough free time to also write comments ...

## Day 3

... Not enough free time to also write comments ...

## Day 4

Like last year, I really have to find a faster way to parse the input.
All those `split` are not good!

Anyway I solved the problem without much problems, once the script
ran without error, the solution was right.
